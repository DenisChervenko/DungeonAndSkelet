# DungeonAndSkelet

The code was written in about 2 weeks, I set myself a goal to do everything as 
quickly as possible. I doubt that the code is good in writing, or productive. 
I will not make any corrections to improve performance, although I see several 
problems with the script responsible for the pool of objects in the update method.


For me, writing all the scripts was a great indicator of my growth in programming.
Before that, I had another project that I had been developing for 3 months, 
and its complexity in writing was scanty, although there were a couple of moments,
for example, a character selection system, the introduction of a similar system in the first project took me 2 weeks, 
the implementation in the current project took 3 hours
